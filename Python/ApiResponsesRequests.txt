--------------------------------------
Sample responses from the RESTful APIs
and API request formats
--------------------------------------
The names of the headers written in the request formats are the real current header names.
(These are probably needed in the API calls.)





User Login - String

Sample Output:
"Login Success" OR "Login Failure"

Request Format:
    URL: http://server-address/userlogin
    Headers:
        email (string)
        password (string)





Branch Info - Dictionary: { branchId: branch }

Sample Output:
{
    "1": "Evergreen",
    "2": "Fremont",
    "3": "Pleasanton",

}

Note: Though the returned dictionary has IDs as integers, the test requests seem to return strings. 
This applies for all returned dictionaries in the API. (Keep in mind)
